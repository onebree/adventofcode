# [Advent Of Code 2015][0]

Santa was hoping for a white Christmas, but his weather machine's "snow" function
is powered by stars, and he's fresh out! To save Christmas, he needs you to collect
**fifty stars** by December 25th.

Collect stars by helping Santa solve puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available
on each day in the advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete
the first. Each puzzle grants **one star**. Good luck!

- [Day 1][1]: Not Quite Lisp (:star: :star:)
- [Day 2][2]: I Was Told There Would Be No Math (:star: :star:)
- [Day 3][3]: Perfectly Spherical Houses in a Vacuum (:star: :star:)
- [Day 4][4]: The Ideal Stocking Stuffer (:star: :star:)
- [Day 5][5]: Doesn't He Have Intern-Elves For This? (:star: :star:)
- [Day 6][6]: Probably a Fire Hazard (:star: :star:)
- [Day 7][7]: Some Assembly Required (:star: :star:)
- [Day 8][8]: Matchsticks (:star: :star:)
- [Day 9][9]: All in a Single Night (:star: :star:)
